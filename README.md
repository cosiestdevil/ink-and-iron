# Ink and Iron
### ***Command the battlefield as if it were painted for war.***

**Ink and Iron** is a turn-based strategy game set in a vibrant mid-fantasy world, where every clash unfolds across a hand-drawn, ink-brush battlefield. Choose a rising civilisation, command its armies, and guide it toward victory through steel, spellcraft, and cunning.

Wage war across maps shaped by organic, Voronoi-style territories, each cell a uniquely carved domain influencing movement, tactics, and control. Every decision you make leaves its mark — just like the strokes of the world’s war-room map.

## A World Painted in Conflict

Lead your people through shifting alliances, ancient rivalries, and contested lands. Whether through martial strength, arcane mastery, or strategic dominance, carve your legend into the parchment of history.

Strategic Depth, Clean & Intuitive Play

Master three core unit archetypes — Melee, Ranged, and Magic — each with upgrade paths unlocked through a robust tech tree. Specialize in elite infantry, empower devastating battle-mages, or craft the perfect combined-arms force to crush your enemies.

## Key Features

### 🗺️ Non-Uniform, Living Maps
