# Ink and Iron
### ***Command the battlefield as if it were painted for war.***

**Ink and Iron** is a turn-based strategy game set in a vibrant mid-fantasy world, where every clash unfolds across a hand-drawn, ink-brush battlefield. Choose a rising civilisation, command its armies, and guide it toward victory through steel, spellcraft, and cunning.

Wage war across maps shaped by organic, Voronoi-style territories, each cell a uniquely carved domain influencing movement, tactics, and control. Every decision you make leaves its mark — just like the strokes of the world’s war-room map.

## A World Painted in Conflict

Lead your people through shifting alliances, ancient rivalries, and contested lands. Whether through martial strength, arcane mastery, or strategic dominance, carve your legend into the parchment of history.

Strategic Depth, Clean & Intuitive Play

Master three core unit archetypes — Melee, Ranged, and Magic — each with upgrade paths unlocked through a robust tech tree. Specialize in elite infantry, empower devastating battle-mages, or craft the perfect combined-arms force to crush your enemies.

## Key Features
### 🎨 A War Room Come to Life

An ink-brush aesthetic brings the battlefield to life as if sketched by a master cartographer. Watch the map bloom, stain, and shift with the flow of war.

### 🗺️ Non-Uniform, Living Maps

Fight on procedurally-shaped Voronoi maps where no two territories look or play the same. Terrain isn’t just scenery — it’s the foundation of your strategy.

### ⚔️ Three Paths to Power

Develop your civilisation across Melee, Ranged, and Magic branches, unlocking stronger units, unique abilities, and empire-shaping technologies.

### 👑 Multiple Roads to Victory

Win through conquest, arcane supremacy, territorial control, or other evolving victory conditions.
